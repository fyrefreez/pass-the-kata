# pass-the-kata

The "rules" for round 1
1. This is the cloud version of our coding dojo
2. Anyone who has attended a coding dojo may contribute - Greg that means you can code!
3. We'll start in C# - but it's days are numbered as the only language of dojo
4. A line is anything that ends in a semi-colon
    That means classes, methods, braces, comments and even projects are not lines and can be changed as much as you like - (but also deleted by the next person for free!)
5. On your turn you may change 5 lines. A change is either
    Add a line
    Remove a line
    Edit a line
6. We'll cycle in alphabetical order - that way I get to start :P
7. You have up to a day to make your contribution, then it passes to the next person
8. We're done when everyone passes without making any more changes - i.e. everyone is happy with the code
9. We'll start with FizzBuzz - but we'll do it the way I learned it. 
    It's called FizzPop
    Any number divisible by 7 should be replaced by "Fizz"
    Any number with a 9 in it should be replaced by "Pop"
    Any number meeting both criteria should be replaced by "FizzPop"
